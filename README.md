# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
---
#### Restaurant Review App

### Requirements

Browser and Internet access. The restaurant maps rely on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), a free service (with limitations), and you should get your own token.

### To launch

Set localhost and port in dbhelper.js, then start server and open index.html in a browser.

### Features

Mobile first design optimized to three viewport sizes. Service worker for caching and offline use.

### Purpose of this project

This was a Udacity mobile web specialist project [(origin)](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). It was practice in developing a mobile first, accessible, offline capable web application. Finding and writing media query breakpoints instead of relying on frameworks (no Bootstrap) was fun, as was managing a service worker.
